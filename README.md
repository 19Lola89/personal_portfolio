# Personal_portfolio

## A template for personal porfolio

The purpose of this project is to build a responsive website containing various navigation, visual and interactive tools for easy access to information.
The content of the page is build so that it could be used as a template for future editing and adding information to personal portfolio.

I have used css and html to build seperate sections, learnt a wide variety of properties and features of those languages and it dramatically expanded my understanding of how those two website building mechanisms work. It is rollecoaster and a thrill ! :)
